    "In Python, the right shift (`>>`) and left shift (`<<`) operators are used for bitwise shift operations on integers. These operators shift the bits of an integer left or right by a specified number of positions. Bitwise shift operations are often used for low-level bit manipulation, such as encoding and decoding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of both operators with examples:\n",

    "1. **Right Shift Operator (`>>`)**:\n",
    "   - The right shift operator shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "   - It discards the rightmost bits and fills in the vacated positions on the left with either zeros or the sign bit, depending on whether the integer is signed or unsigned.\n",
    "   - The syntax is: `x >> y`, where `x` is the integer to be shifted, and `y` is the number of positions to shift.\n",

    "   print(result)  # Output: -3 (Binary: 11111111111111111111111111111101)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Left Shift Operator (`<<`)**:\n",
    "   - The left shift operator shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "   - It discards the leftmost bits that exceed the size of the integer's representation and fills in the vacated positions on the right with zeros.\n",
    "   - The syntax is: `x << y`, where `x` is the integer to be shifted, and `y` is the number of positions to shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example 1 (left shift by 1 position):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 6  # Binary: 0110\n",
    "   result = x << 1\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 12 (Binary: 1100)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example 2 (left shift by 3 positions with overflow):\n",

    "   x = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "   result = x << 3\n",
